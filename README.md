# Udacity-Learning-Journey

This repository highlights my projects and key learnings from Udacity Nanodegree programs, including programming, web development, and AI. It showcases my applied skills and progress across these disciplines.

## Projects

#### Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow
**Key Skills**: Supervised learning, deep learning, dimensionality reduction, clustering; 
**Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

1. [**Finding Donors for CharityML**: Predicted whether individuals earn over $50,000 using census data and supervised learning. ](https://github.com/BuzzHeng/cd0025-supervised-learning/tree/master)**   
   - **Applied**: Data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).

2. [**Image Classifier**: Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify images into categories. ](https://github.com/BuzzHeng/IntroML-TensorFlow-P2_Image_Classifier)**  
   - **Applied**: CNN, transfer learning, image preprocessing, model evaluation.

3. [**Identify Customer Segments**: Identified customer segments for a mail-order company using demographic data from Germany.  ](https://github.com/BuzzHeng/IntroML-TensorFlow-P3_Identify_Customer_Segments)**
   - **Applied**: Data cleaning, PCA for dimensionality reduction, k-means clustering, demographic analysis.
