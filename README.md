# Udacity-Learning-Journey-
This repository highlights my projects and key learnings from Udacity Nanodegree programs, including programming, web development, and AI. It showcases my applied skills and progress across these disciplines.

## Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow
###### Project
1. [Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/BuzzHeng/IntroML-TensorFlow-P1_Finding_Donors)
   Predicted whether individuals earn over $50,000 using census data and supervised learning.
   - **Key Skills**: Data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM), hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV).
2.  [Image Classifier](https://github.com/BuzzHeng/IntroML-TensorFlow-P2_Image_Classifier)
   Built a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify images into categories.
   - **Key Skills**: CNN, transfer learning, image preprocessing, model evaluation.
3.  [Identify Customer Segment](https://github.com/BuzzHeng/IntroML-TensorFlow-P3_Identify_Customer_Segments)
   Identified customer segments for a mail-order company using demographic data from Germany.  
   - **Key Skills**: Data cleaning, PCA for dimensionality reduction, k-means clustering, demographic analysis.
